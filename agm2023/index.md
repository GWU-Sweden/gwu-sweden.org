### 2. Board's Annual Report

Following is a brief report of GWU Sweden's activities for the period May 22nd 2022 ‚Äî May 21st 2023.

#### Board

The board has consisted of Linus Neuman, chair; Love Arvidsson, secretary; Simon Haggren, treasurer; and Mat Sieradzi≈Ñski.

#### Activities

It has been a slow year due to the board being too busy to focus on the organization.
The overall goal has been to spread awareness and try to arrange meet ups.

We have a rather steady influx of members and we are now 85 members.

#### Finance

We've gotten 2000 SEK in donations since the last AGM, and we've had 2169 SEK in expenses. Thanks to donations last year, we landed at 190 SEK in the account.
The biggest expense is the yearly fee for the bank account (1250 SEK/year) followed by the Swish-fee at 39 SEK per month.

#### GWU International

 GWU International are still pending us mending our bylaws to join, which is something we've put off to figure out what's right for GWU Sweden.

#### Members

GWU Sweden membership went from 76 to 85 during the period.


Take care,  
Linus, Love, Simon, and Mat.
Stockholm, 1st of May, 2023.


### 3. Auditor Report

GWU Sweden 2022 Audit (Karl Zylinski)

I was granted access to four board meeting protocols through google drive, which are all in
good order.

2022 started with the setup of a new board. The chairperson is Linus, secretary is Love and
treasurer is Simon. A fourth person called Mateusz is present at all meetings, I assume this
person is an ordinary board member without a specific role. I would recommend having a full
list of board members, including those without specific roles.

During the first meeting it was decided that Linus was going to go to the bank to get access
to the GWU Sweden bank account for Linus and Simon. Judging from the rest of the
meeting notes of the year, it seems that Linus and Simon have gotten access to log into the
bank, but they can't really do anything once logged in. This makes Simon's work as treasurer
impossible. If a new board with a different treasurer is appointed this year, this process must
become much faster.

Some focus has been on whether GWU Sweden should host more physical meetups, but no
such meetups seems to have been arranged. Discussions about attending events such as
The Thing 2022 were done, but it is unclear if anyone actually went. Iit was mentioned that
the tickets were quite expensive.
T
here has been some discussion about advice for games industry newcomers, if information
to newcomers should be available somehow from GWU Sweden. Outreach to Students
about workers rights was mentioned and Mateusz was going to try to use his connections at
FutureGames to look into this. Mateusz has since then been mentioning GWU in lectures
across Sweden.

During the last meeting (2023-01-12) it is stated that the frequency of board meetings has
lapsed and that membership applications are handled sporadically.

All in all it seems like GWU Sweden has had quite an inactive year, there have been some
plans but little seems to have been done. Judging from the meeting notes, the only action
that seems to have taken place is that the bank account issues have been partially handled
(however, Simon still doesn't have proper access) and that Mateusz has been doing
outreach in lectures.

Despite the inactiveness, the board has not done anything wrong and I recommend to free
them from any liability.
