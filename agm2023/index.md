### 2. Board's Annual Report

Following is a brief report of GWU Sweden's activities for the period May 22nd 2022 ‚Äî May 21st 2023.

#### Board

The board has consisted of Linus Neuman, chair; Love Arvidsson, secretary; Simon Haggren, treasurer; and Mat Sieradzi≈Ñski.

#### Activities

It has been a long year where the board has put all effort into separating Tobias's private initial setup for GWU, into GWUs hands as an organization instead.

We established the following goals:
* Finishing the transition process and decoupling the board entirely from Tobias.

The organization now knows the membership process, how to update the website, and more.
However, as Tristan has been relieved from his duties due to personal reasons, there is no board member with access to our bank account. Getting access for Linus and Love has been a hurdle so far.

* Establishing the presence of GWU Sweden in the industry.

We have established a Twitter-process which enabled us to get some attention on social media and landed us two interviews.
One interview in SvD, and one in Flamman.

* Growing the membership of GWU Sweden

We have a rather steady influx of members, but it's not in the pace we desire. For various reasons, we have not been very active and we have not been able to meet up in person.

#### Finance

Coming soon

#### GWU International

GWU International has merged back into one big org instead of two separate ones.
They have invited us to join, but we have not been able to spend any effort or time on this unfortunately as it requires changing our bylaws which is too time consuming at the moment.

#### Members

GWU Sweden membership went from 69 to 76 during the period.


Take care,  
Linus, Love, Simon, and Mat.
Stockholm, 23rd April, 2023.
