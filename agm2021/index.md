### 2. Board's Annual Report

Following is a brief report of GWU Sweden's activities for the period May 25th 2020 ‚Äî May 22nd 2021.

#### Board

The board has consisted of Tobias M√∂llstam, chair; Linus Neuman, secretary; and Tristan Louet, treasurer.

#### Activities

It has, of course, been a different and quite long year. From an organizational standpoint there hasn't been much movement. With the access to financial services last year we've setup processes to keep our bookkeeping in order, which is nice of course. As for how we in the board work I feel we are improving in both meeting structure and tracking/follow-up of action points, although there haven't been any big tasks‚Äîmostly month to month upkeep and admin.

The reshaping of the membership process is something we've had on the todo all year but have yet to really start up. The Membership Committee is still around to dicuss this in more detail (looking for chair!), so come join the `#membership` channel on Discord if you'd like to take part.

#### Finance

Profits for the fiscal year consits of **3 000 kr** from donations and loss consists of **2 085 kr** in administrative costs (the financial services themselves) landing at a forecasted result of 915 kr in profits (fiscal year closes end of May).

The initial investment of time, money, and effort to gain access to financial services have been made (you can Swish GWU Sweden on 123 49 262 67 :tada:), with some exceptions such as gaining a debit card, setting up proper warrants ("fullmakt") for access. It is not the most fun thing that our only expenses are the financial services themselves, but the stage is set for the next year's board to start using donations for the GWU Sweden's actual purpose.

#### GWU International

GWU International has had quite a shaky year. From basically tearing down its existing form to restructure from the ground up, to several reports of racist behaviour and harassment that mainly took place during the fall of 2019 but really came to light during the summer of 2020.

The result of the restructuring is GWU International having been split into 2 branches (with the opportunity for more): (1) the Organizing Branch focused on US and Canada where joining a union is not as straight foward and thus is more about organising behind the scenes and across workplaces, and (2) the Federated Branch where joining/creating a union is not a massive hurdle and this is more about cooperation between these unions and groups.

The Federating Branch consists of GWU Germany, GWU Italy, STJV (France), and GWU Australia last I saw. GWU Sweden was part of discussions in the creation of the branch charter but is not a member, yet. For this to happen we probably need to brush up our bylaws to conform to the charter which includes electing a Chapter Delegate (separate from the Chapter Coordinator which according to our bylaws is the Chair, so yours truly). This delegate would represent GWU Sweden in any assemblies on the Federing branch level. Changes to the bylaws require an Extraordinary General Meeting to bring the org membership together for a vote, and I could've wished this preparatory work had been done by this year's board but it remains a task for the next year's board to pursue.

The Federating branch approves of our efforts to seek membership, but it is entirely up to us in GWU Sweden‚Äîas with or without membership we are still a fully autonomous organization.

#### Members

GWU Sweden membership went from 57 to 69 during the period.


Take care,  
Tobias, together with Linus and Tristan.

### 3. Auditor Report

The board meeting minutes are in good order and available in Drive. The AGM minutes have been added to Drive as discussed last year. That is all excellent!

Documents such as the association registration and the bylaws are not in the Drive. This was mentioned last year, and could be worth addressing.

The board meeting minutes reflect the organisation as a whole: slow going, slow to setup, and mostly inactive. There has been great progress with the bank account and accounting setup, and that is fantastic to hear!

A lot of things have not been followed-up on or got heavily delayed. We are all busy and in a bad shape due to the Covid situation and that makes is all understandable, however a summary of loose ends still seems useful to provide:

- Bank account: the last board meeting minutes (2021-04-06) mention signing and sending in papers to get an organisation debit card: I confirmed with Tobias that this is delayed because the card needs to be tied to a specific person, which is not ideal right before a new board gets voted in. Overall the bank setup has taken an absurdly long time, but it has not caused major issues and seems to be getting resolved.
- Accounting and taxes: The accounting document in the Drive folder does not give me full confidence that there is sufficient accounting and tax knowledge in the board to do things right. This is compounded by the mention of papers being sent late to Skatteverket: verifying with Tobias showed this to be the Inkomstdeklaration 3, and that no ombud has been registered for the organisation, making administration more complicated. Again I certainly understand how this could happen, but it will need addressing.
- Membership process and dedicated channel: Some discussions happened last year and the minutes mention wanting and failing to follow through. There has not been activity in the channel since. This will need to be reprioritised at some point.
- GWU International: The reorganisation seems mostly complete at this point, and procedures were done for GWU Sweden to join the EU/AU branch. This was unfortunately not communicated to members. There is also mention of required amendments to bylaws and election of a delegate, which do not seem to have happened. How urgent is this?
- Tobias is stepping down: How much is still in his name, and is there a transition process planned?

To be blunt, the overall picture I get is that Tobias took on a lot of tasks and was too busy to deliver on all of them, especially during a year where everything went to hell. That is fair! He is not planning to run again, but we do not want to repeat the same pattern with the next chairperson. This all needs to be addressed at an organisation level, and we should take it after the AGM once the new board is chosen.

Overall I still recommend freeing the board of liability, with the caveat of any penalty for the late income declaration.
